  Scenario Outline: Perform simple arithmetic operations 1 5 x
    Given I have two number <param1> and <param2> into the calculator
    When I perform <operator>
    Then the result should be <expected_result> on the screen
  Examples:
    | param1 | param2 |operator       | expected_result |
    | 12     |   6    |division       | 2               |
    | 6      |   12   |division       | 0.5             |
    | 1.5    |   2    |multiplication | 3               |
    | 25     |   10   |multiplication | 250             |
    | -5     |   -2   |subtraction    | -3              |
    | 25.5   |   10   |subtraction    | 15.5            |
    | -5     |   -3   |addition       | -8              |
    | 10.5   |   10   |addition       | 20.5            |
